I previously wrote about my process to publish posts to my blog. In the meantime I have been quite busy and the way it works has now changed quite a bit.

Previously, I had a [single script](https://github.com/obrhubr/obrhubr.github.io/blob/5521915354da232c5bc40c8d8a035f6c7d2fd953/notion_export.py) called `notion_export.py` living in my [blogâ€™s repository](https://github.com/obrhubr/obrhubr.github.io) that downloaded all posts and their assets and simply copied them into my `_posts` directory. I ran this script daily using GitHub Actions, that was it.

But as I added more features the script grew in size drastically. This is why I refactored it into a standalone tool: `notion-to-jekyll`.

It still fundamentally works the same, but itâ€™s a âœ¨python packageâœ¨ now. However, there have been a few upgrades.

- Instead of downloading all posts, it only exports those that have changed in the last 24 hours (which makes it a lot faster).

- It logs any changes to [Logsnag](https://logsnag.com/) and notifies me.

- It supports inline equations that work with [Katex](https://katex.org/), which means I donâ€™t need JavaScript to render them with [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org/) on the frontend.

- It converts all images to `.jpg` and renames them to an MD5 hash of their content, which fixes the ugly filenames on my blog.

- Use the captions on Notion to add correct alt-text to the images.

- and a lot more small detailsâ€¦

Here is what that looks like on the terminal (Iâ€™m quite proud of my progress bars):
