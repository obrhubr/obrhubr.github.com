<h2>Design</h2>
<p>
    The design was originally inspired by <a href="https://jameshaydon.github.io/">James Haydon’s blog</a> and grew over time. The font I use on the site was taken from <a href="https://xeiaso.net/">xeiaso.net</a>, thank you for providing this great font!
</p>
<p>
    The content is edited on Notion and then pulled into a markdown document using a custom built tool based on <a href="https://github.com/echo724/notion2md">notion2md</a>. 
    If you want to use this tool too, you can! 
    Head over to the repository at <a href="https://github.com/obrhubr/notion-to-jekyll">obrhubr/notion-to-jekyll</a> - you can customise it to fit your use-case with the provided command line options.
