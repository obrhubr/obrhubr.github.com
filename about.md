Hey, my name is Niklas ([Github](https://github.com/obrhubr)). I'm a developer from Austria.

### Work Experience

### Acknowledgements

The first version of my site's design is heavily inspired by [James Haydon's Blog](https://jameshaydon.github.io), which I loved and discovered through hackernews.

I could also not have done this without the great [notion2md](https://github.com/echo724/notion2md) project.
