### Acknowledgements

My site's design was heavily inspired by [James Haydon's Blog](https://jameshaydon.github.io), which I discovered through HackerNews.

I could also not have built this site without [notion2md](https://github.com/echo724/notion2md).

The font I use on the site was taken from [xeiaso.net](https://xeiaso.net/) as detailed in [this article](https://xeiaso.net/blog/iaso-fonts/). Many thanks for providing this great font!
